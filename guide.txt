🌿 1. Presence → Home

Instead of “Home,” you’re starting with a state of being.
It immediately sets the emotional tone: the user arrives and feels anchored.

🌸 2. Quiet Impact → Testimonials / Case Studies

It tells a story about the difference you make — softly, without bragging.
It fits your brand voice and the visuals you already have (“Our Way of Quiet Impact”).

🪷 3. Practice → Offerings / Method

Perfect for where you explain your sessions, philosophy, or rituals.
It feels lived, not marketed.

🌼 4. Community → Social Proof / People

If you plan to include stories, shared reflections, or even a small “collective,” this section label feels warm and inclusive.

🌙 5. Begin → CTA

Instead of “Sign Up,” you’re using something invitational, calm, and forward-moving.
“Begin” feels like a journey — not a transaction.
